# Walnut Starter Project

![walnut banner](assets/walnut_banner.png)

### Overview

A good example to get you started with using `stype`. The app is centered around
a walnut with a secret number inside.

Every time you shake the walnut, this number increments. Every time you hit the
walnut, the shell gets closer to cracking. You can only look at the number once
the shell is cracked.

### Local Development

First, go through the [`contracts` README](packages/contracts/README.md) to set up the `Walnut` contract.

Then, go through the [`cli` README](packages/cli/README.md) to set up and run the CLI.
